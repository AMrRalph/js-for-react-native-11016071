### Task 1
So for task 1, I was asked to create a function that takes an array of numbers as an argument and returns a new array where each even number is squared and each odd number
is tripled.
So in the function I created, I created an array that will be returned as the final array after everything has been done. And then I looped through the input array and then checked if each number was even or odd. If even, the number is squared and if odd, the number is trippled. And then for every operation dont on each number from the input array, the result is pushed into the array I created.

### Task 2
For task 2, I was asked to create a function that takes in two arrays as arguments. The function is supposed to modify the strings in one input array based on the numbers in the other input array. If the number is even, the string is converted to uppercase and if odd, the strign is converted to lowercase.
How I did thiiis was that I pick each number from the numbers array and then I check if it is even or odd. If it is even, I go into the strings array and go to the same position the number was in, in its array and then I convert it to uppercase. If the number is odd, I go into the strings array and go to the smae position of the number in its array and then convert the string there into lowercase. After every coonversion, the modified strings are pushed into a created array in the function. 


### Task 3
I was required to create a funcction that takes in two arguments and returns an array of objects in a new file. But the inputs depend on the outputs of the other functions. In order to do this, I exported the functions and imported them into the new file that I created. So what the function basically does is that it picks the first element from one input array, picks the first element to from the second array and then gives an ID and makes that an object. It does that until all the elements of the arrays are exhausted. For every object. An ID is assigned as well. It begins from 1, ,that is the first object and then the second object has an ID of 2 and it continues that way.
